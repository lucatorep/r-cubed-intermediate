As we our tools for generating data become more\nsophisticated and powerful, we also need to start using more\nsophisticated and powerful tools for processing it. Training on how to\nuse these tools and build modern data analysis skills is lacking for\nresearchers, even though this work is highly time-consuming and\ntechnical. As a consequence of this unawareness of the need for these\nskills, how *exactly* data is processed is poorly, if at all, described\nin scientific studies. This hidden aspect of research could have major\nimpacts on the reproducibility of studies. Therefore, this course was\ncreated specifically to start addressing these types of problems.\n\nThe course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons,\nwhere the instructor and learner code together, and is interspersed with\nhands-on exercises and group work using real-world datasets. This\nwebsite contains all of the material for the course, from reading\nmaterial to exercises to images. It is structured as a book, with\n\"chapters\" as lessons, given in order of appearance. We make heavy use\nof the website throughout the course where code-along sessions follow\nthe material on the website nearly exactly (with slight modifications\nfor time or more detailed explanations).\n\nThe course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to\nwrite the lessons and create the book format,\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\nrepository of the material, and [GitHub\nActions](https://github.com/features/actions) with\n[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the website. The\noriginal source material for this course is found on the\n[`r-cubed-intermediate`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intermediate)\nGitHub repository.\n\nWant to contribute to this course? Check out the\n[README](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intermediate/blob/main/README.md)\nfile as well as the\n[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intermediate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfile on the GitLab repository for more details. The main way to\ncontribute is by using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and creating a [new\nIssue](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intermediate/issues/new) to\nmake comments and give feedback for the material.\n\n## Target audiences\n\nThis website and its content are targeted to three groups:\n\n1.  For the **learners** to use during the course, both to follow along\n    in case they get lost and also to use as a reference after the\n    course ends. The learner is someone who is currently or will soon\n    actively be doing research (e.g. a PhD or postdoc), who is likely in\n    biomedical research, and who has no or little knowledge on coding\n    in R. A more detailed description of who the learner is can be found\n    in @sec-is-it-for-you.\n2.  For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the\n    code-along sessions and lectures.\n3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much\n    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a\n    guide to running and instructing their own workshops.\n\n## Re-use and licensing {#licensing}\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"><img src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png\" alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\"/></a>\n\nThe course is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) so\nthe material can be used, re-used, and modified, as long as there is\nattribution to this source.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe course material draws inspiration from these excellent resources:\n\n-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)\n-   [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)\n-   [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)\n-   [UofTCoders Reproducible Quantitative Methods for\n    EEB](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/)\n-   [Software and Data Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) workshop\n    material\n\nThe [Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology\nAcademy](https://www.ddeacademy.dk/) hosted, organized, and sponsored\nthis course.
